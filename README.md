"# Vehicle-Sales-System-SQL"
This project defines the structure of a database for a vehicle sales management system. The database includes tables for managers, employees, vehicles, and sales, with relationships to ensure data integrity.

Additionally, a view (relatorio) generates a sales summary, including the manager, employee, vehicle, sale value, and transaction date.
